Very basic implementation of a Graph using structs. 

This was inspired by an on-going private repo Algo-Visualizer which visualizes algorithms using graphs in pure C.

I figured I'd create this as a base repo and add on to it. New features to be added will be determined by features I'll need from this data structure as my project progresses.
